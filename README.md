# CalcIt UWP
This is another version of the calculator app CalcIt that is written in C# to run on the UWP, just for the visuals, I think.

## Documentation
Refer to [Documentation.md](https://github.com/leduyquang753/CalcIt-UWP/blob/master/Documentation.md).

## Building
Just open the solution in Visual Studio (preferrably the latest version) and build it.
